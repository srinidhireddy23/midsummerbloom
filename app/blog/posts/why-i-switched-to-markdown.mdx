summary: "A brief note on why Markdown became my go-to format for writing blog posts and documentation."
---

For the longest time, I wrote everything in Google Docs and Word. It worked—until it didn’t.

Switching to Markdown simplified everything. I no longer had to worry about formatting glitches, font inconsistencies, or bloated files. Just clean, readable text with structure and clarity.

## Clean Writing Environment

Markdown forces clarity. With just a few symbols—`#`, `*`, `>`, and backticks—you can create rich formatting without lifting your fingers from the keyboard.

It makes the writing process faster and more focused.

## Version Control Friendly

Since Markdown files are plain text, I can track changes in Git, collaborate seamlessly, and revert edits without fear. That’s a game-changer for technical writing.

## Works Everywhere

Whether it's blogs, README files, documentation, or note-taking apps like Obsidian—Markdown is the common language.

Once you go Markdown, it's hard to go back.
